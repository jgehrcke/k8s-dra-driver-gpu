# Allow only one workflow at any time, and cancel in-progress (only) upon push
# to the same branch. The jobs below are run in parallel, and they are both
# cancelled when this cancel criterion hits in. Note that `github.head_ref` is
# only set for pull_request events. In our repository, after merge-to-main or
# for copy-pr-bot-managed branches, the `head_ref` is undefined. The || operator
# below provides a fallback: when github.head_ref is undefined, use github.ref
# (e.g., refs/heads/main). This ensures each branch gets its own concurrency
# group, preventing cross-branch cancellations while still canceling in-progress
# runs when new commits are pushed to the same branch. Note that using `ref`
# isn't great usage in context of pull_request events (head_ref for pull
# requests yields the actual source branch name).
